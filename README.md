I DemoAnswersAI

I have implemeneted this as per AppStore UI reference.
I haven't use any type of dependencies for this project.

I only create custom Views for progressbar and Toast message.
Moreover, for UI animation i have used UIView.animate method which is provide by Xcode Swift language.

You can run this app in any iphone devices.
For icons I have used SF Symboles, please make sure you have those icons.
